### Labels are working as tag
### Selectors are working as a filter with Labels
### You can add as many labels as you like.

## Use of SELECTOR
```angular2html
kubectl get pods --selector app=web-service
```

### Kubernetes objects use labels and selectors internally to connect different objects together.

### The labels defined under the template section are the labels configured on PODs.

### The labels at the top section are the labels of REPLICASET.
