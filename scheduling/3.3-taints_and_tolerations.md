### Taints and toleration are used to set restrictions on what parts can be scheduled on the nodes.

### Taints are always applicable on Nodes.

### Tolerations are always applicable on Pods. And by default PODs have no tolerations.

### There are three taints effects.
1. NoSchedule   (The PODs are not be scheduled on that node)
2. PreferNoSchedule  (System will try to avoid to placing the PODs on that node but thats not guaranteed)
3. NoExecute (The new PODs will be scheduled on that node and exiting PODs on the node)

```angular2html
kubectl taint nodes <node_name> <key>=<vaule>:<taint-effect>
```

```angular2html
kubectl taint nodes node2 app=blue:NoSchedule
```

```angular2html
kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint
```
