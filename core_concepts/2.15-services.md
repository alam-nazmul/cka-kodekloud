### There are three types of services
1. NodePort
2. ClusterIP
3. Load-Balancer

### NodePort is running as port mapping.
### NodePort's valid port range is from 30000 to 32767.

### Note: If you do not mentioned the TARGET_PORT then the TARGET_PORT and PORT value will be same. If you do not mentioned the NODEPORT then it will take a port randomly from 30000 to 32767.
