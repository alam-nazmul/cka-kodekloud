The replication controller helps us  run multiple instances of a single pod.

Replication controller is older technology where ReplicaSet is latest.

To create a replication-controller: `kubectl create -f file.yaml`

To show the replication-controller: `kubectl get replicationcontroller -o wide`

To delete the replication-controller: `kubectl delete replicationcontroller myapp-rc`

ReplicaSet can monitor the pods by their labels.

To run the update replicaset file: `kubectl replace -f file.yaml`

To edit any running replicaset: `kubectl edit replicaset name`

To scale the replicas on running mode: `kubectl scale replicaset name --replicas=5`
