## Switching

Check the interface `ip link`

Assign an IP address `ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth1`


## Routing

Add route `ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1`

Set default route `ip route add default via 192.168.2.1`

### By default packets are not forwarded via their received port.

Thats why need to modify `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip-forward` from 0 to 1.

Unfortunately this a temporary solution. If you want to permanently save that `/etc/sysctl.conf`
